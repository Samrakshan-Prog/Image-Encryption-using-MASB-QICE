# 🔐 Image Encryption & Decryption System

A secure image encryption and decryption web application using **Multi-Agent Swarm Behavior (MASB)** and **Quantum-Inspired Chaotic Encoding (QICE)**. Built with **Flask** (Python backend) and **AngularJS** frontend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt images using MASB + QICE algorithms
- Decrypt encrypted images back to original
- AngularJS-powered interactive UI
- Flask-based REST API integration
- Clean separation of frontend and backend logic

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, AngularJS
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Encryption Method**: MASB + QICE
- **Other Tools**: OpenCV, NumPy
